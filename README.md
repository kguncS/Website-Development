# Website-Development
This project consists of multiple webpages introduced in a website designed by me as a school project. Main page has a basic application to keep track of the visitors. 
Html-css files for both webpages, and the application code developed with python that is represented in bottle framework are present int his repository. All of the images are taken from google and are not licensed by me.
